# What?

As we use `git` frequently to manage our web projects, it is common to make a mistake to run the `npm` commands with `git` e.g. we type
`git install` instead of `npm install` or `git start` instead of `npm start` etc as mistake.

Then here this tool comes to solve these issues: Now you can run any npm command directly as git command like run `git install` to install npm modules
or run `git test` to run test cases or even run `git start` to start the server, you don't need switch `git` to `npm` ðŸ˜Ž, BE LAZY.

## How does it work?

It just adds `aliases` for every npm commands to git and it doesn't affect the existing git commands, so you are good to go.

```bash
npm install -g git-plus-npm
